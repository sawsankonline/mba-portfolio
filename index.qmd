## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a results-driven MBA candidate at University Canada West (expected graduation: December 2025), with a background in retail operations, team leadership, and a passion for music and digital transformation.

Currently working at **Save-On-Foods** as a General Clerk since September 2024, I am pursuing opportunities to transition into **Operations Management**. I bring strong experience in team collaboration, customer service, and continuous improvement.
